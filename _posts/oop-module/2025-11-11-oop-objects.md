Before we begin, let's begin with a definition that we'll dissect and base our lesson off of. Don't worry if you don't understand what it means now because the definition is essentially what this lesson will be all about.

Object: A collection of properties and methods. 

Objects can represent actual real-world objects, but also more broadly, anything that has properties, including you! We could represent you as an object.

You have properties such as:
- Name
- Eye color
- Height
- Country of residence
- Ethnicity
- Language
